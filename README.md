This is a  Asynchronous Advantage Actor Critic (A3C) Reinforcement Learning model developed for the Alien game in the Gymnasium library.
Convolutional Neural layers are considered to capture the features in the photos and then Recurrent Neural Layers (LSTM) are considered to capture the temporal dynamics of the game.
